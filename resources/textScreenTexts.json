  "One day I felt like making a website you are currently on.",
  "I made this website solely for my own amusement and I do not want to show off what I do with my free time. In fact, I don't know what you are doing on this website...",
  "Here you'll be able to read a short description of projects that I have completed and that hold a certain value in my memory.",
  "Sometimes having a place where you can recall what you have been with your time is useful and also fun.",
  "So enjoy :)"
