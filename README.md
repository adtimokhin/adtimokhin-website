# My website

## Why

> That's a fair question.

I felt that in the past years I have created a number of projects that I want to remember. "Pride" is a word that I would use to describe a feeling that drove that project onwards.

## What

> What?

This webiste is a masterpiece. It will never end up in Madame Tussauds or in Louvre. Those places don't disserve that beauty.

I made the website myself using the time that I had. I am happy with the result :)
